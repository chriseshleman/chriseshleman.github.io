It's tough enough learning to post straight from R Studio via R Markdown so instead of a substantive post I'm just going to post a placeholder. This is a markdown file built in R Markdown and converted through R's knitr package. Thanks to a gazillion people for drafting tutorials to help me figure this out. 

```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
