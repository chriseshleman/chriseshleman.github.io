Alright, I went to the Administration's open data portal and secured FARS data for 2016: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars-ftp-raw-data

There's a ton of stuff there. FARS stands for the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. It's a census of roadway fatalities and includes a signifcant amount of identifying information including geographic coordinates. 


```r
library(stringr) 
library(doBy) 
```

```
## Loading required package: methods
```

```r
library(ggplot2) 
acc = read.csv("/Users/chriseshleman/Downloads/accident.csv") 
  names(acc) = tolower(names(acc)) 
acc = subset(acc,acc$state==34 | acc$state==36) 
acc$county = str_pad(acc$county, 3, pad = "0") 
acc = summaryBy(fatals ~ county, data=acc, FUN=sum); names(acc) = c("county","fatals")
```

OK, first calculate fatalities in any point in the metro area. First I need to reconcile geographic units because FARS uses a funky county code.
