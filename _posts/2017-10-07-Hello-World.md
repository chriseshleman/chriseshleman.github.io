title: A project in progress.

I'll be using this site to hold my feet to the fire re: various data projects. 

The idea is to track progress via periodic posts. Put another way, to shame myself into sticking with my extracurricular data science efforts. I'll try and use R Markdown and posting progress via Github. 

There’ll be no beta mode here, I'm just going to dive in and keep it simple at the start. I expect to do a few small projects every month or two. Nothing too intense — the value I bring to this stuff isn't a mastery of coding but an understanding of causality and, with it, some insight into what a given analysis might be able to tell us and what it can’t. 

Along the way I'll toss in some useful data visualization. And while I won't aim [quite this high]( http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/nyregion/of-crime-subways-and-the-no-5-train.html?pagewanted=all) I'll try and make it fun.
