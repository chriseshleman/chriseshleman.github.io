A look at the Brooklyn Public Library's open data catalog would give you ... well, roughly zero idea of what's on the shelf. 

Let me clarify. And let me be clear. (Those are almost synonymous.) I love the public. I'm there every few weeks. And I used to go practically every week. I taught myself the lion's share of what I know about R in the commons room. 

So I downloaded a .csv of the library's catalog set from the City of New York's open data portal. (This one: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

It looks like this: 

```r
library(rgdal) # reads spatial files 
```

```
## Loading required package: methods

```
## Loading required package: sp
```

Well then. Quite a mess. 

So here's another public data set. It's a tally of the City's three-year-old universal pre-kindergarten program. The mayor's 2013 campaign included a few major pledges, and the one he arguably delivered more effectively than others was providing free, full-day universal pre-kindergarten to any 4-year-old. His staff invested considerable resources in finding space for locations. Enrollment opened at 19,000 children the first year and grew to 68,000 a couple of years later. 


```r
upk = read.csv(url("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/kiyv-ks3f/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")) 
names(upk) = tolower(names(upk)) 
```



```r
boxplot(upk$seats) 
```


```r
table(upk$seats,upk$borough)  
aggregate(upk$seats, by=list(Category=upk$borough), FUN=sum) 
```


I can use ggplot2 to plot the new pre-k locations. It takes downloading and unpacking some spatial files first.

I can also plot the same locations scaled by the number of spots ("seats").
