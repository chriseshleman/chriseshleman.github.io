There's an old analysis rolling around of 311 data and its use across groups in New York City. 

I've been part of refreshing and reusing it to death. So I'm going to put it through its final iterations and then be done with it. 

This will be that refresh. 

It basically seeks to analyze 311 data, which is already being done by the research community, to understand variation in social efficacy across groups. 

What we tried to do differently was to incorporate data on the actual work done by public agencies. I'll work out the details later.
