US and transit
--------------

I read an article about the United States' (lack of) investment in
transit. I had a visceral and judgmental response.

Why has the US invested less in transit?

Let's compare the US to the rest of the world's highly developed
nations. I'm leaving Singapore out given its position as a city-state
and Hong Kong for the same / similar reasons.

    hdi = read.csv("./hdi_cleaned.csv") 
    hdi = hdi[order(hdi$HDI.Rank..2017.),] 
    hdi = head(hdi,15)
    names(hdi) = c("country", "hdi") 
    hdi = hdi[-c(9), ] # Remove Singapore 
    hdi = hdi[-c(7), ] # Remove Hong Kong 
    hdi$country = trimws(hdi$country) 

First, the US has got a lot of land and the population has spread itself
across much of that space.

    density = read.csv("/Users/chriseshleman/Dropbox/pages/chriseshleman.github.io/_drafts/US-and-transit/API_EN.POP.DNST_DS2_en_csv_v2_10135655/Land_cleaned.csv") 
    density = data.frame(density$Year, density$X2017); names(density) = c("country", "pop_per_km") 
    density = density[order(-density$pop_per_km),] 
    head(density,10)

    ##                  country pop_per_km
    ## 145     Macao SAR, China  20546.766
    ## 148               Monaco  19347.500
    ## 207            Singapore   7915.731
    ## 95  Hong Kong SAR, China   7039.714
    ## 83             Gibraltar   3457.100
    ## 21               Bahrain   1935.907
    ## 151             Maldives   1454.433
    ## 158                Malta   1454.037
    ## 26               Bermuda   1308.820
    ## 19            Bangladesh   1265.036

    density$country = trimws(density$country) 

    dat = merge(density, hdi, by="country", all.y=T) 

That's a lot of space over which to lay railroad track, which is
expensive. See?

Germany, Denmark, Holland, England ... they're all naturally positioned
for densite, capital-heavy, cost-effective (well-used) transport
infrastructure to help people get around.

Second, because US residents are spread across so much land, and because
the auto industry is such a strong political interest group, and because
of national interests related to road congestion, safety and national
security, historic investments in the highway network and local roadway
systems have a legacy influence.

    roads = read.csv("/Users/chriseshleman/Dropbox/pages/chriseshleman.github.io/_drafts/US-and-transit/road_network.csv") 
    roads = data.frame(trimws(roads$Country), roads$Road.length..km.)
    names(roads) = c("country", "road_km") 
    roads$road_km = as.numeric(gsub(",","",roads$road_km)) 

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    roads$country = trimws(roads$country) 

    dat = merge(dat, roads, by="country", all.x=T) 

The persistence of a strong financial incentive for home ownership has
added to this situation by turning highways into, in part, a collection
of shared driveways.

I love trains, be they subways or intercity Amtrak lines. But at this
point it would make little policy or economic sense to start laying
track everywhere when buses that use new technology for efficiency
improvements could, with a few exceptions (New York, for example) do so
much more with fewer dollars. The savings could help accomplish more
elsewhere.
