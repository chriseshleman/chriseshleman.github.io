Once upon a time I figured out how to generate a random variable. This is the two line story of that discovery. 




```r
x = ts(rnorm(50)) 
plot(x,main="White noise") 
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

```r
xx = qplot(seq_along(x), x) 
ggsave(xx,file="/Users/chriseshleman/Dropbox/pages/chriseshleman.github.io/images/Random_points.png", width=8,height=5) 
```

```
## Don't know how to automatically pick scale for object of type ts. Defaulting to continuous.
```
